# Python-Coursework
Coursework from my 1st year University 'Introduction to Programming Module'. I was tasked with creating a library management system in Python (3.7) using a procedural programming paradigm. The only libraries I was allowed to use were tkinter and matplotlib to create the user interface. Before running this program you will need to have the tkinter and matplotlib libraries installed, preferably through PyCharm which is the IDE I used. To run the program: download all files and run the menu.py file.
