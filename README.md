# Python-Coursework
Coursework from my 1st year University Introduction to Programming Module. I was tasked with creating a library management system in Python using a procedural programming paradigm. The only libraries I was allowed to use were tkinter and matplotlib to create the user interface. To run the program: download all files and run the menu.py file.
